I'm Michele [miˈkɛːle], NLP R&D Scientist at [Okra.ai](https://okra.ai/), working in Medical NLP. 
My primary interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Vision, Natural Language, Cognitive Sciences**, and **XAI**.

I've received my Phd from the [Institute of Linguistics & Language Technology](https://www.um.edu.mt/linguistics/) at the University of Malta, 🇲🇹, supervised by Prof. [Albert Gatt](https://albertgatt.github.io/) and co-supervised by Prof. [Kees van Deemter](https://www.uu.nl/staff/CJvanDeemter.
Here I was a Marie Curie PhD Fellow and Early Stage Researcher in the [NL4XAI Project](https://nl4xai.eu/) 
During my Phd, I worked as a Visiting Researcher at the [University of Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en), 🇳🇱 focusing on Multimodal Grounding and interning at the 🍊Orange Innovations Labs, Lannion, 🇫🇷.

Previously, I was Machine Learning Research Scientist at Aptus.AI, a RegTech startup based in Pisa, 🇮🇹.
I earned my Master's in Computer Science and AI, at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/) 🇮🇹, with a thesis project in NLG carried out as a Visiting Researcher at the [Center for Language and Cognition of the University of Groeningen (CLCG)](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/?lang=en), 🇳🇱 .
 I've also collaborated with the [ItaliaNLP Lab](http://www.italianlp.it/) at the Institute of Linguistics of the National Research Center (ILC-CNR) based in Pisa, 🇮🇹.
