I'm Michele [miˈkɛːle], an NLP R&D Scientist at [Okra.ai](https://okra.ai/) working on medical NLP. My research interests sit at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, cognitive science, and explainable AI (XAI).

I received my PhD from the [Institute of Linguistics & Language Technology](https://www.um.edu.mt/linguistics/) at the University of Malta, supervised by Prof. [Albert Gatt](https://albertgatt.github.io/) and co-supervised by Prof. [Kees van Deemter](https://www.uu.nl/staff/CJvanDeemter). I was a Marie Curie PhD Fellow and an Early Stage Researcher in the [NL4XAI project](https://nl4xai.eu/).

During my PhD I was a visiting researcher at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en), where I focused on multimodal grounding, and I interned at Orange Innovation Labs in Lannion, France.

Before joining Okra.ai, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Scientist at Aptus.AI, a RegTech startup in Pisa. I earned my Master's in Computer Science and AI at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/), completing an NLG thesis as a visiting researcher at the Center for Language and Cognition (CLCG) at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/?lang=en).

I've also collaborated with the [ItaliaNLP Lab](http://www.italianlp.it/) at the Institute of Linguistics of the National Research Council (ILC-CNR) in Pisa.
